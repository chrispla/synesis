Robustness
    [ ] Implement covariate robustness
	[ ] Train or load model
	[ ] Evaluate transformed
    ===>[ ] representation distance<===
		[ ] model predictions
		[ ] model uncertainty

Disentanglement
    [ ] 

Test
    [ ] Downstream - full
    [ ] Downstream - aggregated
    [ ] Test DynamicBatchSampler
        [ ] Can it be shuffled?
    [ ] Predict transform
    [ ] Predict transformed

Logging
    [ ] Implement wandb

Datasets
    [ ] Implement TinySOL
    [ ] Implement Beatport

Non-music Datasets
    [ ] Search for a few representative Datasets
    [ ] Implement a few
    [ ] Make adjustments to fit new data types

Transforms
    [ ] Enclose torchaudio transforms to be callable from config
    [ ] Add more transforms
